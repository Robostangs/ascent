Frisbee Tracker: Testing/Requirements

What its supposed to do:
    -Counts Frisbees
        -This tells shootSwitch whether (or not) it should add the frisbee or (not) allow the frisbee in the robot. 
    -Uses a timer in order to see if a frisbee is ingested in the robot 
    -Uses a timer in order to see if a frisbee is about to enter the lift
    -Uses a timer in order to see if a frisbee is going to pass through the shooter

Ways it could break:
    -Frisbee gets jammed while on a button
    -Frisbee arrives at the shooter/lift earlier than the timer expects
    -Frisbee skips/passes over the sensor that counts them
    -Doesn't correctly determine whether or not to let a frisbee in

Ways to Test:
    +Physically:
        -Insert the frisbee into the robot at different angles, speeds, and orientations
        -Test the different buttons on the Xbox Controller in different orders
        -Have the frisbee go into the Ingestor, Lifter, and Shooter and varying times and orders 
    +Code:
        -Read through code to correct any errors in timers set time.
