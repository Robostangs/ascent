Frisbee Tracker: Testing/Requirements

What it is Supposed to do:
    -Counts Frisbees
        -It tells shootSwitch if it should add the frisbee or not ingest the frisbee
    -Uses a timer in order to see if a frisbee has been ingested
    -Uses a timer in order to see if a frisbee is going to enter the lift
    -Uses a timer in order to see if a frisbee has passed through the shooter

Ways it could Break:
    -Frisbee gets jammed on a button
    -Frisbee passes/skips over the sensor that counts them
    -Frisbee enters lift/shooter earlier than timer expects

Ways to Test:
    +Physically:
        -Insert frisbees in the robot at different angle and positions
        -Try different combinations of Xbox buttons
        -Shoot, lift, and ingest in different orders
    +Code:
        -Read through the timer times
